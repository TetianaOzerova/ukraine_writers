Cada detalhe pensado para você, um quarto silencioso, com lençóis brancos e limpos, espaço nos armarios para acomodar suas coisas, banheiro privativo, com todas as necessidades oferecidas, toalhas, sabonetes( no plural mesmo) shampoo, condicionador, etc.  Cozinha com bolo e café quentinho, e para completar: - A sala!  Um caso a parte essa sala, a sala com uma vista de acalmar a alma e encher os olhos, tanto do lado de dentro, como do lado de fora há beleza, Há detalhes, há cuidado. Ida é só cuidados e atenção. Ida é a melhor conversa, o melhor papo, o melhor sorriso. Imagine tudo isso. Imaginou? Então, - Assim é a casa de Ida.

However, I had a couple issues with this trip. This is nothing against Raed or his place. Both the apartment and the host are great. Just a few logistical, subjective-comfort, and communication related things. \\n\\nWhen asking Raed about potential noise in the apartment, before I booked, he said \\\"this is all very subjective... it should be fine.\\\" When I got to the apartment, there was major construction (which begins at around (8-9AM) surrounding the apartment (the apartment is on a right angle on a major intersection near Place de Arts) and the music from nearby festivals (very loud) begins in the afternoon and ends late at night at around 11PM-12AM. \\n\\nI was aware of how close the festivals were, but based on Raed's comment, I figured it would be relatively quiet and didn't anticipate such loud music and construction. I was a bit annoyed when I got to the apartment and for the first few days, I was bombarded with construction early in the morning and then blaring music for most of the day. This may have been miscommunication, or maybe it is a new issue, but I felt somewhat misled. Now this might not bother anyone else, which is fine. But I did ask about the noise level before I booked. And yet, the experience I had wound up contradicting what I had been told by the host. So make sure you ask specific questions if you have specific concerns. And if you are looking for quiet during the day — good luck!\\n\\nThere was also some initial confusion when trying to book the apartment because the dates that were listed as available were not actually all available. In fact, I had to change my reservation from June 12-26 to June 12-20 because Raed had his own plans with the apartment from the 20th onward but this was not reflected on AirBnB and it wasn’t until after I booked my dates that I found out the the apartment wouldn’t be available after the 20th. This lack of clarity in communication was pretty inconvenient for me. Plus, I had to wait to hear back from and constantly inquire with Raed when trying to find out the actual available dates to see if the apartment was going to be available or not. Even after I booked, the dates listed as available remained inaccurate. If I didn't keep contacting him, I'm not sure how things would have turned out. This put a some stress on my travel plans, which were admittedly very last minute. I realize Raed was probably very busy, but it's always the little, logistical things that matter.\\n\\nDespite these relatively minor issues, I must state that Raed was very accommodating and responsive during my actual trip, very friendly, and in the end - he was very considerate by allowing me to check out a few days early.\\n\\nGreat apartment.

The nice rooftop is included in the description for this place, so that was a major selling point for me to book the space, making it simply disappointing that I didn’t have access.  The host was not able to provide an answer on how to get acesss to the rooftop.   Finally, I booked the entire apartment, and it was listed as full apartment access.  The room you actually get is the smaller room with the bed that looks more slim and less comfortable.  I had a good rest in the room I slept in, but I assumed that having the apartment to myself would allow me to sleep in the nicer room that is actually pictured on the website.

I initially chose this place because of the good location, reasonable price, and altogether excellent reviews. The location is indeed good, but everything from the first communications to checkout was extremely disappointing. For the checkin, the host told me I would meet one of his friends in Taksim. When I got there, I waited over half an hour, trying to reach the friend, until I called the host. He then told me to come straight to the apartment (rather than waiting for the friend at Taksim), which was another fifteen-minute walk away. I should mention that I've traveled to Istanbul before so I'm familiar with the area, but juggling my luggage and trying to find a route on my phone was quite a hassle. When I arrived, the host was brusque, unfriendly, and did not give me a chance to even survey the apartment. I would go on to discover that almost everything in the apartment was broken and covered in a noticeable layer of grime. The toilet cover was gone and the water wouldn't stop until I reached my hand in the back tank and pulled a lever; the pole holding up the shower head was snapped off; the kitchen sink effectively had two settings--steady drip and explosive deluge; the handles on the cupboards were broken; part of the floor was taped over; one of the stove tops was broken; and the washing machine door wouldn't close. Then there was the cleanliness issue: both the kitchen and bathroom sinks were constantly swarming with small flies, the shower was still covered in the last guest's hair, the utensils and other cooking materials were encrusted with old food, and the floor was coated in grime. I was barely able to stomach scrubbing and boiling the bare utensils I would need to survive, and I ate out as much as was feasible. The apartment also lacked toilet paper when I first arrived. The host did bring some over, but only a day after I contacted him about it. After a day or so of living there, I noticed that periodically a strong smell of sewage would permeate the entire room. Windows closed or opened, it was unavoidable. The host said he'd never had complaints of a bad smell before, but for me at least, it was impossible to miss. One day, the water was shut off--this was likely an issue for the entire neighborhood, but it's never happened to me during prior trips to Istanbul. Though it didn't bother me, potential guests should also be aware that you can hear EVERYTHING the people upstairs do. I seriously considered leaving the apartment early and finding another place to stay, but unfortunately this was not financially feasible. Lastly, I contacted the host more than 24 hours before I planned to move out to arrange where to leave the key and what...\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"186257236\",\n                \"date\": \"2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"2023934\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"4290299\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Laurent\",\n                \"comments\": \"Tres bon rapport confort/situation/prix pour Istanbul.

She has newspaper clips and brochures of things that are in the area and gave us tips on things to do. Her home is right at the shore and a windmill from 1709 so the walks always seem to have an amazing view, especially accompanied with some ice cream from a little shop around the corner from her place.

Luckily Wan Chai is quite the gastronomic delight so we didn’t have a problem eating our meals out and finding new places all around the area to eat.

After a short introduction where to sleep, and where to hang your your clothes, you are left alone in somebody else's nice and shiny clean apartment. Really a big wow type experience. And it is of course the very basic Airbnb, to tactfully and with great respect of other people's belongings stay in another person's apartment. What more is there to say? Of course the apartment was well cleaned, in very good condition, with all the necessary tings to cook, fry, iron, wash and so on.\\nWe slept very well, and the whole area is full of shops, restaurants, bars and so on, all very closely together and in an small area easily reached by walking.\\nTo visit Istanbul from Nalan's apartment is very simple,  you have the boats close by, going to most parts of the town. Going to Taksim square? Easy - take the boat to Kabatas, when there take the Metro one stop, and you are there. Grand Bazaar? Again easy, boat to Karaköy, cange to tram going over the bridge you just went under, get off at Beyazit stop. Get a Istanbul card, works at trams,  boats, metro and busses.

Can also go up to roof for great view of city skyline or just to chill out. \\r\\n\\r\\nWas very busy during my time there, so made minimal use of kitchen, but it has gas range, fridge, dishwasher – everything needed to settle in or just prepare quick meals and snacks. Wireless Internet, too. Everything provided for bath and kitchen. Rented for about a month and apartment worked well.

They are very invested in the unit and everything in it and how it will be used. My first time to use Airbnb, so having the owners that involved was a little unlike other experiences where have rented for weeks and months at a time elsewhere in the US and Europe. They, too, may still be getting used to the idea of renting out their apartment, and how to furnish it and let go to reduce their anxiety. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"87146285\",\n                \"date\": \"2016-07-18T04:00:00.000Z\",\n                \"listing_id\": \"533168\",\n                \"reviewer_id\": \"26431219\",\n                \"reviewer_name\": \"Isleide\",\n                \"comments\": \"Olivia and Bob are the perfect hosts.
